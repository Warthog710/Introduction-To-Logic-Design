# Introduction-To-Logic-Design
This is an introductory course in the fundamentals of designing digital computer hardware. This course covers: logic gates, binary number system, conversion between number systems, Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, combinational logic, digital logic design, flip-flops, programmable logic devices (PLDs), counters, registers, memories, state machines, designing combinational logic and state machines into PLDs, and basic computer architecture. The lab is design oriented and emphasizes the use of software equation entry tools, schematic entry, and logic simulation tools. Lab assignments are design oriented. This course is required for Electrical/Electronics Engineering and Computer Engineering majors at some universities. This course is also helpful for Computer Science majors, electronics technicians, and for students wishing to sample computer engineering.
